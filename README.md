# HorrorMovieDatabase
 This project was produced as part of a dynamic web development module in late 2019
 
 The module's prompt was to choose a category of thing, and develop a dynamic website which showcases a selection of those things.
 I chose horror films, trying to recreate the rough idea of IMDB.
 
 the project includes account creation and maintenance, RSS feed processing, an API which was constructed for efficiency
 and the use of JSON files for security when using the API.
 
 Please bear in mind this project is 18 months old, at time of writing, and is by no means perfect.
 As part of the course, the website developed weekly, and the links at the top of the index page lead to older versions, some of which do not work.
